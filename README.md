# spooktober-2021

This is my entry for the [F# Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/fsharp-jam-oct21), I'm not a game developer but in the spirit of F# and community I decided to practice my skills with F# and Sutil a little bit.

Also this game is powered by [Sutil](https://sutil.dev/) + [Fable](https://fable.io/) + Perla as a frontend project it also allow me to identify bugs and short-comings in [Perla](https://github.com/AngelMunoz/Perla) a Frontend Developer Dev server
